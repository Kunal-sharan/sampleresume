  <br>
  Hi, my name is Kunal Sharan, I am a first year engineering undergrad doing <abbr title="Electrical and Computer Engineering">E.C.E</abbr> major.
  <br>
  <br>I like web development and designing (just started and will do great in the field) .<br>
  <br> I am  a Zonal level badminton player (pretty average in almost all outdoor sports and some indoor sports).
  <br>
  This is because I had no real experience doing web development ‚Äî and not much programming experience in general beyond some basic C# and Java training I got from a few online courses. I also didn‚Äôt have a computer science degree since I graduated with a degree in IT project management.
  I'd never written about my experience despite all the help I've received from wonderful resources like Medium, Stack Overflow, and Reddit's programming subreddits.
    <br>
    <br>
   I'd just like to say I really enjoyed writing this, and it makes me really happy to have been finally able to give something back to the incredibly supportive programming community everywhere.
   As some of you already noticed, this is my first blog post, but you can be sure I plan to write more. Just don‚Äôt expect one every week. Remember: quality over quantity!
